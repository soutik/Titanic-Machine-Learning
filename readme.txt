# Titanic Machine Learning

In this challenge we tried to achieve a higher score in the Kaggle Competition.

## Methods Implemented:
1. Feature Engineering
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. RandomForest
5. Conditional Forest

## Improvement for future:

This model has been developed for Precision instead of Recall while in a real situation when this model would be used to save lives, we need to model for recall.
